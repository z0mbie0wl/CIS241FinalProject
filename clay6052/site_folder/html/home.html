					<h1>About Me</h1>
			
					<p>Hello, my name is Sierra. I am interested in web development and graphic design. I am a web development student at Edmonds Community College, 
					where I am pursuing a Web Application Development degree. I plan to continue school after acquiring my associates degree.</p>
			
					<p>I've never really been passionate about web development but I like coding. And with the way things are going during the pandemic, I assume
					web development will have even more job growth in the coming years than what is currently projected. Because graphic design is also something 
					that I am interested in, I will probably aim towards front-end web development. I'm aiming to take some graphic design classes to help acheive this goal.</p>
			
					<p>After taking the Web Dev I class, I am definitely enjoying the prospect of working in web development more. There are many things that I did not know
					were possible. Figuring out how to place things and make them work is fun. I am excited to see what I will learn as I continue towards a degree in web development.</p>
